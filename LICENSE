Copyright (c) Garrett's Workshop

Rationale
----------------------------------------
We at Garrett's Workshop create our products and release their source in
hopes of encouraging others to contribute and build their own "clones,"
even selling them and competing with us. One day, GW will be defunct,
and it would be a shame if our hardware and software die along with GW.
At the same time, however, we seek to protect our trademark and ensure
that clones and derivative products do not masquerade as genuine
Garrett's Workshop products.
